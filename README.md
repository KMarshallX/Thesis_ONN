This code is still under development, for faster training purposes, I tried to overfit the model to a small dataset (20 iteration through 5000 samples from MNIST written digits dataset), 
it converged at (data)loss=1.4598, accuracy=45% (Â±10%).\

This model can be further improved by using larger size of dataset, and a low learning rate, however, this could cost 1 day to run through all of the 60,000 samples in the original MNIST data
